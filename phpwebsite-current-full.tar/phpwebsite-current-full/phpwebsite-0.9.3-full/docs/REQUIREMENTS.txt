Requirements for running phpWebSite
-----------------------------------

This is a list of the system requirements to run phpWebSite.

FILE REQUIREMENTS
------------
We in no way endorse or support these packages, and we assume the
packages are already installed correctly and running on your
system.

PHP v4.2.2 or greater

The PEAR base package must be installed with the following
additional packages (phpWebSite ships with these packages
included. See: ./lib/pear/):

Date-1.3 >=
Benchmark-1.2 >=
HTML_Common-1.0 >=
HTML_Form-1.0 >=
HTML_Table-1.3 >=
HTML_Template_IT-1.1 >=
Net_CheckIP-1.1 >=


PERMISSIONS
------------
It is assumed that you have the ability to alter your directory
permissions. Please read the INSTALL.txt file for more information.

If you do not have the ability to CHOWN directories, contact your
systems administrator.

To setup phpWebSite you will need the following
directories to be writable:
conf/
images/
docs/

After installation, the conf directory should be readable ONLY.
images/ and docs/ should remain writable by the web server.

Note that you are taking a risk by keeping your images and docs directories
world writable (chmod 777). Get your site administrator to chown them
to apache.apache instead.


MEMORY
------------
We strongly recommend increasing your memory_limit variable in
your php.ini file to 10 - 12M (php.ini uses 'M' not 'MB' as an abbreviation).
By default, PHP runs at 8M.

Here are the minimum memory requirements:
5M Core ONLY
8M Most modules. May have problems if all modules are installed.
9M Minimum requirement for all modules installed.

If you are unable to change the php.ini file, you can attempt to 
allocate memory at runtime by uncommenting this line in your core/Core.php
file:

ini_set("memory_limit", "12M");

Note that this setting may not be supported on your web server.

Special Notice: If you are converting data from phpWebSite 0.8.3, it is
recommended that you temporarily increase your memory limit to 16MB.
If you are unable to change this limit, do not convert all modules
at once. See the CONVERSION.txt document for more information.
