    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Announcements module allows site administrators to post
    important news or announcements to their main page. It allows future
    announcements to be queued up and automatically posted on their specified
    date. It also has support for expiring announcements. This allows an
    administrator to have an announcement removed from the main page
    automatically on a specified date. The announcement module also allows for
    site visitors to submit their announcements for an administrator to
    approve. This feature is a great way to allow your site visitors to have a
    voice on your site.</para>

    <para>An announcement can consist of several parts. The only required
    parts are a subject and a summary. Optional parts include a body, image,
    category, post date, and expiration date. The announcements module will
    automatically assign the post and expiration dates for you but they can be
    changed at any time. When creating</para>
