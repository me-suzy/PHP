    site, let's take a look at a typical site. By identifying the various
    elements that make up your site from a visitor's perspective, the
    administrative interface will make more sense once you begin using the
    tools.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The page pictured below represents a fairly typical phpWebSite
    generated web page - no doubt you have seen something like it many times
    when surfing the web. </p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="screenshot"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img src="images/homepage.png"/></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A menu is in the upper left-hand corner, There is some general
    information site, front and center where we would expect it. Several
    important notices are on the site and some information is highlighted in a
    column on the far right of the page.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using traditional tools like Dreamweaver or Frontpage, our approach
    to building a page like this would be to start placing graphics, links,
    and text on a &quot;blank&quot; page much like we would create a print
    document. After a bit of work, we could reproduce the page above. And we
    would have produced just that - a single, solitary page.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now let's pause a moment and look at the main administrative
    page for phpWebSite. A few things stand out. We are looking at a web page
    in a browser, and the layout area common to many web page generation tools
    is nowhere to be found.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="screenshot"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img src="images/modules.png"/></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Instead we have a collection of icons and links. These represent the
    various modules that allow you to provide and manage content for your
    site. Unlike single-page generation tools, phpWebSite serves as a
    framework that dynamically organizes your content. Each page you view on
    your site is the work of many modules providing information that the
    phpWebSite engine puts together into the web page viewed by the site
    visitor. Let's look at that original web page again, this time showing
    the modules that are working together to build the page:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="screenshot"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img src="images/homepage_module_use.png"/></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What we see now is that phpWebSite has gathered up and presented the
    information on the site based on the module used to provide it. Different
    modules handle different types of information. One of the keys to using
    phpWebSite successfully is using the right module for the right
    information. In the pages that follow, each module is covered in detail.
    The important thing to note at this point is that we manage our site by
    managing our content. This is why phpWebSite is frequently referred to as
    a &quot;Content Management System&quot;.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You may be wondering how to control to control the layout of a page.
    You should note that the layout of the example given is just one of the
    many possible. Layout is controlled via the layout module in combination
    with HTML templates, both of which are covered later. Rest assured that
    pretty much any look and feel can be achieved - here we are just
    interested in 'information elements' that comprise a site.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk01ch01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk01ch02s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Who Publishes phpWebSite? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Making a New Block - a Mini Tutorial</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
