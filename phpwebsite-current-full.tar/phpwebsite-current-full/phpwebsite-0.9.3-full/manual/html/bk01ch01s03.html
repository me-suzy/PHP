    the Web Technology Group at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC,
    USA. The Web Technology group is comprised of both University staff and
    upper level and graduate Computer Science students who provide web based
    software solutions for the Student Development Division of Appalachian
    State. phpWebSite was originally developed as a solution for managing web
    site content at the University and was released as open source software in
    an effort to share our work in a cooperative spirit. Those involved at the
    beginning of the project never would have guessed that phpWebSite would
    grow to become the immensely popular application it is today.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Web Technology group owes sincere thanks to the many external
    developers who took notice of the phpWebSite project and have volunteered
    an enormous amount of time and effort to the project. Our thanks also to
    the many who have chosen to use phpWebSite, your bug reports and good
    ideas for features are extremely valuable. Ultimately, phpWebSite is the
    work of a diverse community of many people across the globe - a tribute to
    the power of shared ideas within the commons.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk01ch01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk01ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk01ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Intended Audience </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Introductory Concepts</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
