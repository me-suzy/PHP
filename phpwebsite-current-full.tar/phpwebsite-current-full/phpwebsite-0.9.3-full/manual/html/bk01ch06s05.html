You
    can assign one or more of these permissions to users.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Go into a user account and you should see a list of modules. Some of
    the modules have sub-permissions. If you want the user have permission to
    use the module, just click the check box to the left of the module name.
    If you want them to have sub-permissions, click the check box to the left
    of it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let's take a look at an example. Let's say we have a new
    user named Larry. First I would make sure the Administrator check box is
    checked. He won't be able to administrate any of these modules
    otherwise.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We want him to be able to create and edit users. It so happens that
    this is a basic functionality for this module. So I check the box next to
    <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">User Manager</b></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are some sub-permissions for the User Manager. If I check Set
    Permissions, then I am pretty much giving him full access to the system
    (he will be able to edit his own permissions). So I leave that unchecked.
    I have decided Larry can delete users if he needs to so I will check that
    box. I do not want him to be able to Delete Groups so I will leave that
    unchecked. Finally, there is no reason he should be able to change any of
    the Administrative Settings so I will leave that blank as well.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That's all there is to it. I would then go through all the other
    modules and decide if Larry needs access to them. When I was satisfied, I
    would click the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Create User</b></span> button (or
    <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Update User</b></span> if he was already in the
    system) and Larry would be ready to go. The next time he logged in, he
    would be able to access the modules I set for him.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">0.9.2 does not support permissions per element. For example I
      can't assign permission for only one person to edit a specific
      PageMaster page. This functionality will be available in version 0.9.3.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk01ch06s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk01ch06.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk01ch06s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Managing Users </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Groups</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
