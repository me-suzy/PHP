monthView.tpl
---------------
Required Tags

ROW1 - ROW6     :  Make sure these rows are included. They make up the grid. Also, you might wish to
                   comment out row6 so it does not appear in a 5 row grid.
WEEKDAYS        :  Displays the days of the week. Read monthViewSettings to decide in what format
                   they appear

Optional Tags
PREV            : A link to the previous month. Not required but makes moving to another month easier.
                  See monthViewSettings for how the link should be presented.
NEXT            : Same as PREV but for next month.

FULL_MONTH_NAME : Displays the full name of the month
ABRV_MONTH_NAME : Displays a three letter abbreviation of the month name
NUM_MONTH_NAME  : Displays the number of the month instead of the name

YEAR_FULL       : Four digit display of the year
YEAR_ABBR       : Two digit display of the year


monthViewWeekdays.tpl
---------------------
COL1 - COL7     : Simply the count of where each day name will appear.


monthViewRow.tpl
---------------------
COL1_BG
thru
COL7_BG         : Controls the background color of a column. Leave it alone in most cases.
                  You can set what appears here in monthViewSettings.tpl

COL1 - COL7     : The day templates are plugged into here


monthViewDay.tpl
----------------------
DAY             : The number of the day
EVENTS          : The listing of the events from monthViewTime is plugged here
FILLER          : Adds extra spaces to fatten the rows



monthViewTime.tpl
----------------------
TIME            : Displays the time of the events below it. You don't have to use this: you
                  could display the time beside the title instead and not group. However this
                  file is included in case you do. Don't remove this file however.
EVENTS          : Adds events from monthViewEvents.tpl


monthViewEvents.tpl
-----------------------
JS_ICON         : A small picture that links to a javascript window description of a event.
                  This will not appear if the user has javascript off.
TIME            : Time of the event. Can be ignored if you are using monthViewTime to block
                  events
TITLE           : Title of the event


monthViewSettings.tpl
------------------------
Be careful editing this file. The comments are VERY important

Backgrounds     : The following three tags are background tags. When triggered, the commands
                  following the tags appear in the COL#_BG portion of the monthViewRow.
                  Use a background color, image, whatever. 

DEFAULT         : Background for regular ole day
TODAY           : Background for the current day
OFFMONTH        : Background for days not contained in the current month

PREV and NEXT   : These two tags are for links to the previous or next month. Make them characters
                  or an image tag.


Set between the weekday comments, the next three tags determine how weekdays appear in the top
row of the calendar.

FULL_WD         : the complete spelling of the weekday name
ABRV_WD         : the three letter abbreviation of the weekday
LETTER_WD       : the first letter of the weekday only


special.tpl
---------------
If you want to assign a special background to a particular day (like Halloween, Labor Day, National
Ice Cream Headache Day) you can use this template.

Make a BEGIN and END comment with the name of the event and put a date tag in the middle.
For example: Christmas 2002 = {DAY_20021225}

After the tag, enter the data you want to appear in the background. In the above case you might
just enter something like:

<!-- BEGIN xmas -->
{DAY_20021225}
bgcolor="red"
<!-- END xmas -->

or you could enter an image. Whatever suits you.
