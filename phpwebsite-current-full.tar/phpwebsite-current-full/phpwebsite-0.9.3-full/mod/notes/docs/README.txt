Notes was developed as a small module to be used in a module
tutorial for aspiring phpwebsite developers. The great thing
about it is that it's also useful!

Notes allows users to send notes to other users or to groups
who are registered on the current site.  Notes can even deliver
messages to deitys.

Sending a Note:
---------------
To send a note, log into the site and select the "Notes" module
from the "My Modules" page.  Then select the "New Note" button.
You can now select which user or group you wish to send the note
to and type in a short message in the space provided.  When you
are finished composing your note, select the "Send" button and
it will instantly be sent to the user or group you specified.

Reading a Note:
---------------
Upon recieving a new note, a small notification box will appear
when you are logged into the site.  To read these new notes, select
"Notes" from the "My Modules" page.  Select the "My Notes" button
from the menu.  This will give you a list of all your current notes.
New notes are marked with a green "NEW" tag and read notes are marked
with a black "READ" tag.  To read a new note simply click on the
linked message.

Sent Notes:
-----------
You can monitor notes that you have sent to other users via the
"Sent Notes" option.  To access your sent notes, select the "Notes"
module from the "My Modules" page.  Select the "Sent Notes" button
from the menu. The list shown is very similar to the "My Notes"
interface.  From this interface you can determine if the user you
sent your note to has read your note yet or not.  You do not have
access to delete notes you have already sent so don't send anything
ugly unless you mean it :)

Note: if a user deletes a note that you sent to them it will no
longer show up on the "Sent Notes" list.
