<font face=Verdana size=2><p>OK, you have provided all the necessary information and your web site is ready for search engine submission. Please note that the control bar at the top of the screen can take some time to show if you are on a slow connection and have asked to submit many pages and/or to many search engines, please also note that the submission process is not a quick process and may take some time, the approximate time that this process will take is shown above. If you do not have this much time or just don't wish to wait this long then you can always start again and ask the script to submit less pages or submit these pages to fewer search engines, this will lower the amount of time the process will take.</p>

<p>To begin the submission process please click on the "Go" button on the above control panel, the script will then show its progress in two different ways, firstly the counter on the above control panel will increment by one every time a page is submitted to a search engine and also the result of the submission process is shown in this area.</p>

<p>This script is licensed under the GNU Public License and is free software, this means that it most likely hasn't gone through rigorous testing periods with hundreds of dedicated beta testers. What this means is that your thoughts count! Any improvements and/or suggestions can be emailed to <a href="mailto: ideas@mattsscripts.co.uk">here</a>, bug reports <a href="mailto:bugs@mattsscripts.co.uk">here</a> or just plain old support for the author can be emailed to him <a href="mailto:matt@mattsscripts.co.uk">here</a>. If you use this script I would appreciate it greatly if you email me telling me what you think of it, or even if it just reads "Hey", that would be cool.</p>
