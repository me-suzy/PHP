<font face=Verdana size=2><p align=center><b>An error occured whilst trying to find your index page</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately I could not find the main index page for your site, this means that I cannot search your site. This could be due to any of the following reasons;</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>This script is being executed on a different web server than the page is hosted on</li>
<li>The domain name supplied does not exist or is temporarily offline for some reason</li>
<li>You have just found a bug in my script (please email me <a href="mailto:matt@mattsscripts.co.uk">here</a> and tell me what happened)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you think that this is just a temporary problem then you can always try again by clicking <a href="index.html">here</a> to go back to the main index page.</p>
